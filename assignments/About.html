                My name is Crystal Zhou and I'm a sophomore student studying at The New School. My major is Design and Technology. I also studied Studio Art at Stony Brook University before. I like working with watercolor and Procreate. Recently, my theme or focus for my art or electronic projects revolve around mental health.
